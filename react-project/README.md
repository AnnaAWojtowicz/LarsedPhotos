notes:

props in Country.jsx and CountryImg.jsx - in both because title and description of country is going to be common for all CountryImg - camera details, map and tags are individual for each img

remember that tags is an array - need to map it!

styling issue - birder line when clicked on symbol:

- in general it should be invisible, first when clicked on symnol, details and golden border on the right should show - remeber to fix it!
